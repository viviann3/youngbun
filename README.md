# youngbun
A kpop card bot coded on discord.js
# Getting Started
get started by typing `;cd` to check your cooldowns. Using `;daily` will give you a random card and a handful amount of üçô.
# Self-hosting
Whilst self-hosting isnt really encouraged as obviously, my code sucks, if you still want to, heres a short guide:

1 duplicate the `config-loadout.json` to `config.json` and fill it out. (except for guild id, thats not required)

2 run `npm i` to install the dependencies


3 run the bot
